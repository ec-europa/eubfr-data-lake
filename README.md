## Requirements

-   Node.js current (8.x)

We recommend you to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) with our local `.nvmrc`:

```sh
# Install node version corresponding to the one defined in .nvmrc
# Use '--reinstall-packages-from=node' if you want to migrate npm packages from a previous version
nvm install

# Use the newly installed version
nvm use
```

## Getting started

Setup your environment:

```sh
yarn
```

Test the services offline:

```sh
yarn offline
```

# Development tips and tricks

EUBFR makes heavy use of AWS cloud services and technologies. This is great for
reducing costs and utilizing modern tools and approaches for solving problems.

However, being able to develop with these services locally is not always the
most straightforward task.

In this section you will find hints on how to improve your development workflows
in a way that will make you work faster and easier with the codebase locally.

## Developing an ETL service

EUBFR is a data lake project. ETLs are the plugins being used for transforming
producers' data from one format and structure to a [desired project model target][1].

Normally, when new producers are introduced in the system, they provide raw files
which serve as the base for building ETLs.

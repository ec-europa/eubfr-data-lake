Objective: 1 
Acronym: + RESILIENT 
Operation summary: +RESILIENT puts together a 4-helix partnership of 8 MED countries to tackle the need for innovation conducive to increased socially-responsive competitiveness of SMEs & stimulate new jobs, especially for companies operating in the social economy. It aims to kickstart a process of policy change at regional level in the involved areas resulting in the integration of successful elements into the new Cohesion policy (EU2020+). The overall objective is to positively influence, adapt/change the different structural elements of policy governing \\"clusters with high social vocation and responsiveness\\" (SVRC) by leveraging on innovation dynamics led by technology, open data & successful models with social relevance & impact, creating socially-responsive value chains at a transnational level. SVRC are usually codified only at local level, so the project addresses the transnational dimension as networking and capacity building approach to achieve a critical mass, increase horizontal opportunities for SMEs, mobility, employability and for scaling up into Cohesion Policy and Funds. It is an integrated project that establishes a structural approach to policy & practice improvement of emerging dynamics in social innovation through an overarching process based on the intertwined use of open data & the creation of a transnational socially-responsive value chain. This includes studying existing initiatives, adapting and testing, with the final objective of capitalizing them in the MED area.

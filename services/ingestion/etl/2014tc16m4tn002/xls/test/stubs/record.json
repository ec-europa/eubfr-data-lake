  "OPERATION SUMMARY / Sintesi dell'operazione": "ARIEL project is jointly promoted and developed by 9 scientific and institutional partners of 4 Countries (Italy, Croatia, Greece\r\nand Montenegro) and focuses on small-scale fishery and aquaculture which are two key drivers for blue and sustainable growth\r\nof Adriatic and Ionian communities. Despite their relevance, those sector faces the same challenges of maritime spatial planning,\r\nenvironmental and socio-economic sustainability, better conditions for innovation uptake and for scientific knowledge\r\ndissemination, more effective cooperation between entrepreneurs, academia and policy makers. In this context, ARIEL\r\ntransnational approach will catalyze joint efforts to tackle this complex ecological, economic and societal challenge supporting\r\nthe development of a transnational “critical mass” and the provision of common skills, tools and methods accompanying\r\nsmall-scale fishery and aquaculture innovation process and networking in the Adriatic and Ionian Sea basin.\r\nARIEL overall objective is, in fact, to promote technological and non-technological solutions for innovation up take of small-scale\r\nfishery and aquaculture in Adriatic-Ionian basin, acting as knowledge network and performing a set of transferable activities to\r\nbetter understand threats and solutions for a more successful and sustainable management of policies and practices.\r\nARIEL will, at first, implement innovation audits on small-scale fisheries and aquaculture enterprises taking into account\r\nresearch, policy and economic aspects outlining the innovation state of play and future development scenario. Based on this\r\nresult, the project will test pilot innovative solutions defined jointly by the enterprises and the research institutions.\r\nInnovation brokering events will facilitate R&D transfer into concrete and feasible actions for small-scale fishery and aquaculture\r\nactors, accompanying their aggregation and cooperation process. The uptake and adoption of open innovation in small-scale\r\nfishery and aquaculture will be also fostered by the setting up of the ARIEL platform helping networking and partnering around\r\ninnovative ideas and solutions during and beyond project life, favoring a permanent knowledge sharing and transnational\r\ndialogue among actors.\r\nARIEL partners will then develop a Joint Research Agenda for small-scale fishery and aquaculture and a Chart of Innovation\r\nServices, a strategic and multidisciplinary action plan defining common priorities and research lines, areas of improvement,\r\nknowledge based solutions and actions to successfully address the major challenges linked to innovation and sustainability of\r\nfisheries and aquaculture for the coming years in the Adriatic and Ionian Sea region.",

  "description": "Acronym: ARIEL 
Operation summary: ARIEL project is jointly promoted and developed by 9 scientific and institutional partners of 4 Countries (Italy, Croatia, Greece
and Montenegro) and focuses on small-scale fishery and aquaculture which are two key drivers for blue and sustainable growth
of Adriatic and Ionian communities. Despite their relevance, those sector faces the same challenges of maritime spatial planning,
environmental and socio-economic sustainability, better conditions for innovation uptake and for scientific knowledge
dissemination, more effective cooperation between entrepreneurs, academia and policy makers. In this context, ARIEL
transnational approach will catalyze joint efforts to tackle this complex ecological, economic and societal challenge supporting
the development of a transnational “critical mass” and the provision of common skills, tools and methods accompanying
small-scale fishery and aquaculture innovation process and networking in the Adriatic and Ionian Sea basin.
ARIEL overall objective is, in fact, to promote technological and non-technological solutions for innovation up take of small-scale
fishery and aquaculture in Adriatic-Ionian basin, acting as knowledge network and performing a set of transferable activities to
better understand threats and solutions for a more successful and sustainable management of policies and practices.
ARIEL will, at first, implement innovation audits on small-scale fisheries and aquaculture enterprises taking into account
research, policy and economic aspects outlining the innovation state of play and future development scenario. Based on this
result, the project will test pilot innovative solutions defined jointly by the enterprises and the research institutions.
Innovation brokering events will facilitate R&D transfer into concrete and feasible actions for small-scale fishery and aquaculture
actors, accompanying their aggregation and cooperation process. The uptake and adoption of open innovation in small-scale
fishery and aquaculture will be also fostered by the setting up of the ARIEL platform helping networking and partnering around
innovative ideas and solutions during and beyond project life, favoring a permanent knowledge sharing and transnational
dialogue among actors.
ARIEL partners will then develop a Joint Research Agenda for small-scale fishery and aquaculture and a Chart of Innovation
Services, a strategic and multidisciplinary action plan defining common priorities and research lines, areas of improvement,
knowledge based solutions and actions to successfully address the major challenges linked to innovation and sustainability of
fisheries and aquaculture for the coming years in the Adriatic and Ionian Sea region.

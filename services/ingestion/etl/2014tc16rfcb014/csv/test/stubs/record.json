  "Operation summary": "ENDED_The project DeDiWe aims at developing digital health and welfare services by creating a new curriculum. The curriculum is built on an e-learning platform to support professionals to live and work in a digital society and to offer citizens easy accessible e-Health services.\r\n\r\nThe project pilots the new curriculum in Finnish, Estonian and Latvian vocational education programmes. The new curriculum promotes multi-professional studying with the ?Learning by Developing? pedagogical model, which gives students opportunities to learn together in real working life. The studies take place mostly on an e-learning platform, combined with cross-border co-creation and cooperation. In the next phase, the curriculum can be spread to all 27 health, social and IT study programmes and 5750 students in partner schools. It can also be spread to the 30 VET/UASs in partner countries and possibly wider in the Central Baltic region and the EU.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the project not only a new curriculum is created but also students have a possibility to implement development projects that are useful for the citizens. The core curriculum is the same for all students, which allows for a variety of professionals to work together. Each partner has its own set of students, but they work on the same e-learning environment. All in all, the project enhances Central Baltic business ecosystem development and creates better opportunities for public-private partnership, therefore supporting eHealth companies.",

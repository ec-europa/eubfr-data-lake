  "Operation summary": "A common challenge in rural societies is that young people move away from their local communities in order to find work and education. By making entrepreneurship more attractive for the youth they could make a living in their local communities. The RIBS project aims at developing young people?s knowledge about entrepreneurship and media literacy by engaging them in cross-border entrepreneurship courses, local and international workshops and exchange possibilities for students, teachers and coaches.\r\n\r\nThe project will organise both local and international business idea workshops to form cross-border teams based on similar business ideas. The teams will be coached in enhancing their business plan and in developing the necessary media and financial skills for the project. The teams will develop their business ideas mainly by using ICT tools but also during cross-border exchanges, under supervision of teachers and coaches.\r\n\r\nDuring the project, approximately 20 joint student companies will be established. The networks of young participants created during their work with the joint student companies can become the starting point for new, creative and competitive cross-border companies in the future.",

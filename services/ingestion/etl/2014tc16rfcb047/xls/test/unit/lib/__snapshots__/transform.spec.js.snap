Operation/Project Summary: The Border and Regions Airways Training Hub (BREATH) Project, led by the Dundalk Institute of Technology (DIT), has been awarded up to €6,781,065.21 ERDF under the INTERREG VA Programme. BREATH aims to tackle Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by harnessing the complementary resources and expertise of the project partners. COPD is an incurable lung disease that is highly prevalent in Northern Ireland, the Border Counties of Ireland, and Western Scotland. COPD imposes a huge economic burden on the Region and it has been forecast that the disease will be responsible for one-third of deaths by 2020. BREATH will provide an innovative, industry-relevant training programme to stimulate R&I, attract inward investment and enhance economic development.

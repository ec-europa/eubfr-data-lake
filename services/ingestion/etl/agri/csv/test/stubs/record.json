  "Project description":
    "<p>Under the EU-funded Central European Green Corridors project, 115 fast-charging stations for electric cars have opened in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia and Croatia – allowing cross-border electromobility with your e-car between Munich and Zagreb. Further network expansion, offers and services for customers and energy supply solutions also drive the project’s roll-out of electric transport. Partners include public sector bodies and private companies.</p>",
  "Results":
    "Installation and operation of 115 fast-charging stations in 5 European countries,Development and implementation of electromobility and cross-border services for e-car users,Strategic planning for a European fast-charging network.Since the implementation of the Central European Green Corridors project, the European fast-charging network for electric vehicles has continued to grow. An additional 200 fast-charging stations – 180 in Italy and 20 in Austria – are developed. The charging networks in the various countries are compatible with each other.

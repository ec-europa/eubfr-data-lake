  "General Information":
    "%L Nitrous acid is of particular importance in atmospheric chemistry, because the photolysis of HONO significantly %L enhances photooxidation processes early in the morning due to the rapid production of OH radicals. The %L proposed investigations will contribute to answer the following specific questions about the formation and %L occurrence of nitrous acid: %L -What are the formation mechanisms and sources of HONO in the atmosphere ? %L -In particular, which heterogeneous mechanisms are responsible for converting NOx (i.e. NO2 into %LHONO) ? %L -What are the parameters of heterogeneous HONO formation which are needed for later inclusion in %Ltropospheric models ? %L -What is the contribution of HONO photolysis to the urban and polar OH budget ? %L According to these questions a co-ordinated workplan comprised of field experiments as well as laboratory and %L modelling studies has been developed. The data which will be obtained will result in a better understanding of %L important chemical processes in the lower atmosphere. %L As a consequence the results from the present study can form the basis to assess the impact of those processes %L on a regional scale, in particular in relation to HONO as a chemical warning signal in urban areas.",

  "About this project": "The EU-funded LIFE CERSUDS project has developed an innovative and sustainable urban drainage system that uses low-value ceramic tiles to filter water through paving. The system provides a way for cities to adapt to climate change by reducing the impact of flooding and facilitating reuse of stored water.\n",
  "Sector": "Development and sustainability, Environment, Infrastructure, Innovation",
  "Background information": "Spain’s Insurance Compensation Consortium estimates that flooding causes €800 million worth of damage per year\nThe LIFE CERSUDS project has set up a 3,200 m2 demonstrator of its ceramic tile-based drainage system in one of the main streets in Benicàssim, Valencia\nValencia produces 80% of Spain's ceramic tiles\nThe system will help resolve flooding problems and provide an outlet for unused stock from the ceramic industry\n",

  "_about_this_project": "The EU-funded LIFE CERSUDS project has developed an innovative and sustainable urban drainage system that uses low-value ceramic tiles to filter water through paving. The system provides a way for cities to adapt to climate change by reducing the impact of flooding and facilitating reuse of stored water.\n",

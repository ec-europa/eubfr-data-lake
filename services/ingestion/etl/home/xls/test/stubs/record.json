  "CR PS Summary":
    "The global objective of InfoMigrants.net is to facilitate access to relevant and accurate news for migrants and refugees through one website and social networks.\nIndeed, the study created by Open University and France Médias Monde, stated that refugees and migrants are using their mobile to connect with friends, family, smugglers and to inform themselves about news across multiple countries. \nInfoMigrants.net’s target groups are coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Soudan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, etc. They’re either thinking about or planning to seek refuge in Europe or have already left their original country and they’re on the road.\nTo reach this target group, InfoMigrants is a media that needs to be “social” at its core. Indeed, one of our main objective is to inform an audience that’s by definition :\n▶ difficult to reach;\n▶ do not trust mainstream medias;\n▶ are highly dependent on their mobiles.\n\nThe marketing strategy put in place took into account the digital habits of our target at home and on the road to develop a targeted promotion campaign.\n\nThe final version of the website, a full platform with mobile first design, additional functionalities, robust architecture, and enhanced security, was launched on the 16th of May 2017 (the first version was launched on the 9th of March 2017). For social networks, Facebook was launched on the 9th of March 2017, Twitter on the 10th of April 2017, What’s App on the 8th of June 2017 and a You tube Channel on the 03/03/2017 and FreeBasics on the 1st of August 2017. \nThe contents created are:\n▶ News and general information about migrants already produced by FMM,DW and ANSA;\n▶ Original articles and features from the dedicated journalists teams;\n▶ Content developed specifically for the social networks: videos, photos, infographics, short articles, etc.\n\nThe marketing strategy associated with the quality and the relevance of the editorial contents and FMM’s, DW’s and ANSA’s international networks and audiences, allowed InfoMigrants.net, just after one year of existence, to reach:\n▶ A total number of 2455K visits to the InfoMigrants websites since the launch of the target website platform (the 16th of May 2017);\n▶ 392 967 fans on Facebook, 4480 followers on Twitter, 1427 subscribers on What’s App and 520 followers on Instagram from its launch in March until December.\n",

    "<p>An extension to a boat docked on the river Danube has proved a hugely popular entertainment and cultural hub. A38, a former Ukrainian freighter ship, was initially transformed into a multi-functional space in 2003. With ERDF-funding, an adjacent second unit was constructed in 2010 and has been a resounding success.</p>",

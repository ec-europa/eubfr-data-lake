Among young artists, these rates can be even higher. At the same time, these new talents are the ones who are able to offer creative and innovative perspectives on economy, society and culture and are the ones to evoke dialogue about our moral parameters. Eight festivals, spread all over Europe and in their core dedicated to support emerging performing artists, have joined forces in the project International Young Makers in Action. Our vision is to strengthen and renew the European performing arts sector by creating opportunities for emerging artists. Our passion is to have emerging performing artists reaching all corners of Europe to have an impact on audiences, peers and professionals. With the unique focus on European emerging artists from all performing disciplines, IYMA will organize the following activities:• Presentation of at least four international performances by emerging artists per festival, adding up to a total of 60. • 15 contextualization programmes for audiences to embed the work in the local context and to offer possibilities for artists and audiences to meet.• 15 in-depth programmes for participating artists to develop their skills, deepen their knowledge, get inspired and broaden their horizon. • 15 presenters’ programmes for international professionals to scout work, get acquainted with artists and actively participate in network meetings and showcases. • 1 LAB WEEK where ten emerging artists explore artistic ideas and methodologies together through workshops, master classes and meetings.All activities will be followed by a group of bloggers. Alongside the activities an audience research will be done on a European level. With the unique combination of the international mobility of artists and an increased connectivity with audiences, peers and professionals, IYMA will offer a valuable contribution to the European performing arts landscape.","ec_priorities":[],"media":[],"programme_name":"Creative Europe","project_id":"552237-CREA-1-2014-1-NL-CULT-COOP1","project_locations":[{"address":"","centroid":null,"country_code":"NL","location":null,"nuts":[],"postal_code":"","region":"","town":""},{"address":"","centroid":null,"country_code":"ES","location":null,"nuts":[],"postal_code":"","region":"","town":""},{"address":"","centroid":null,"country_code":"IT","location":null,"nuts":[],"postal_code":"","region":"","town":""},{"address":"","centroid":null,"country_code":"BA","location":null,"nuts":[],"postal_code":"","region":"","town":""},{"address":"","centroid":null,"country_code":"PL","location":null,"nuts":[],"postal_code":"","region":"","town":""},{"address":"","centroid":null,"country_code":"GB","location":null,"nuts":[],"postal_code":"","region":"","town":""}],"related_links":[],"reporting_organisation":"","results":{"available":"No","result":"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/projects/ce-project-details-page/?nodeRef=workspace://SpacesStore/b0cdaa31-b137-4471-a347-3cfbb8c1ea61"},"status":"finalized","sub_programme_name":"Culture","success_story":"No","themes":[],"third_parties":[{"name":"STICHTING ITS FESTIVAL","type":"Festival (non Audiovisual)","address":"TOLHUISWEG 2, 1031 CL, AMSTERDAM","region":"Noord-Holland","role":"coordinator","country":"NL","website":"","phone":"","email":""},{"name":"TEATRAKO TEATRO ELKARTEA","type":"Festival (non Audiovisual)","address":"ARAUTI 5 181, 48902, BARAKALDO","region":"Extra-Regio NUTS 2","role":"partner","country":"ES","website":"www.actfestival.com","phone":"","email":""},{"name":"ASSOCIAZIONE CULTURALE AREA06","type":"Art association","address":"VIA BUONARROTI 30, 00185, ROMA","region":"Lazio","role":"partner","country":"IT","website":"www.shorttheatre.org","phone":"","email":""},{"name":"JAVNA USTANOVA MES-MEDJUNARODNI TEATARSKI FESTIVAL","type":"Festival (non Audiovisual)","address":"MARSALA TITA 54 / 1, 71000, SARAJEVO","region":"Bosnia And Herzegovina","role":"partner","country":"BA","phone":"","email":""},{"name":"AKADEMIA TEATRALNA IM.

We will do so by promoting the use of virtual stage sets in performing arts, including the use of interactive technologies, Virtual and Augmented Reality and remote-controlled applications. We will create a network of cultural operators that are capable of using new technologies for the performing arts (“providers”) linked in an online community with interested stakeholders such as festival organisers and theatres (“users”).OBJECTIVES: demonstrate that these technologies enhance the aesthetics and overall cultural experience; can encourage the creativity of artists and cultural operators by opening new technical possibilities; increase international cooperation and markets in the creative sector (not limited by linguistic barriers, or transport issues, and driven by tech-savvy people with a generally international outlook); can create and diversify cultural career possibilities;  can assist in audience development by easily bringing the performances to the audience (rather than vice-versa) and by attracting the interest of today’s young generation. ACTIONS: concretely this will take the form of 4 co-produced performances, prepared through distance cooperation and direct workshops. The latter will also be open to numerous local students and professionals in 4 countries. After the production process, we will focus on audience & market development, creating awareness and promoting take-up of the technologies by final beneficiaries (i.e. visitors as well as organisers of cultural performances and events). This will be based on a tour of the performances to the 4 participating countries in 4 dedicated festivals, with effective side-events, and a Europe-wide communications, dissemination and networking plan which builds on the examples of excellence of our four performances.
